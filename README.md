# **Phone Manage Project using Java OOP**

## 1 of 3

##### Project description :

I used TreeSet<> (a collection of Java) to manage a list of Phones.

The reason I use TreeSet<> but not ArrayList<> or different collection is 

TreeSet<> has enough feature for my need

+ Only has one element, no duplicate

+ Maintain ascending order

+ Fast access time
